# Multilevel-Queue-MLQ-CPU-Scheduling

The project is based on the design and implementation of  a module simulating the Multilevel Queue CPU Scheduling. CPU scheduling is a crucial aspect of operating systems, determining  the order in which processes are executed to maximize system efficiency. When comes to the multilevel queue scheduling algorithm, processes are divided into multiple priority queues, each with its own scheduling. Priorities are assigned to processes based on their type, characteristics, and importance. There  are main three components that can be identified in Multilevel Queue scheduling such as System processes, Interactive processes, and Batch processes. This program is designed to overcome the issue that the experience in CPU starvation if higherâ€“priority queues are continuously occupied.
